# CLOB - Central Limit Orderbook trading application

A full stack application, using React for the frontend and NodeJS for services, that implements POC of a Central Limit Orderbook (CLOB) stock trading marketplace. 
It accepts orders via a REST (or WebSocket API) and publishes updates on orderbook state changes or if trades occur.
